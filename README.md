# Rocket-Shot-Game
A 2D interactive rocket shooting game developed in C using graphics.h. Features include user-controlled rocket movement, shooting mechanics, multiple levels, scoring system, visual effects, and simple sound effects. Ideal for learning computer graphics and game development concepts.


## Features

- **User-controlled Rocket:** Move left or right using arrow keys.  
- **Shooting Mechanics:** Fire bullets using the `F` key.  
- **Level System:** Multiple levels with increasing difficulty and faster targets.  
- **Score Tracking:** Points awarded for hitting targets; shots decrease when missed.  
- **Visual Effects:** Stars, colored rockets, targets using flood fill, and smooth animations.  
- **Audio Feedback:** Simple sound effects for firing and hitting targets.  
- **Interactive Menus:** Start screen, Help screen, and Game Over screen.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Graphics Library:** graphics.h (Turbo C/C++ environment)  
- **Sound Library:** dos.h (`sound()` and `nosound()`)  
- **Algorithms Used:** Line drawing, circle drawing, flood fill, collision detection, randomization

## How to Run

1. Open **Turbo C/C++ IDE** or any environment supporting **graphics.h**.  
2. Load the project source files.  
3. Compile and run the main file.  
4. Use arrow keys to move the rocket and press `F` to fire bullets.  
5. Follow on-screen instructions for gameplay.
